    <h1 class="case-title">East African Job Market Analysis</h1>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>A job platform needed to prioritise where to grow: which sectors and geographies had the strongest demand, where supply was falling short, and where product and sales efforts would have the highest impact. Without a clear view of the market, resource allocation was based on assumptions rather than data.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>I analysed job posting and application data across Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania over 12 months. I grouped postings by sector (e.g. Software & Data, Sales & Marketing, Finance, Healthcare, Education) and by country, and compared posting volume to application volume to identify supply–demand gaps. I also looked at experience-level mix (entry-level vs mid vs senior) to spot underserved segments.</p>
      <p>Data sources included internal platform events (postings, applications, views), plus publicly available labour and sector reports for context. Analysis was done in SQL and Python; visualisations in Tableau.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Key findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tech and Sales & Marketing</strong> had the highest posting volume; Healthcare and Education showed the highest applications per posting, indicating strong demand relative to supply.</li>
        <li><strong>Kenya</strong> accounted for roughly 45% of postings; Uganda and Tanzania showed faster quarter-on-quarter growth, suggesting room to grow there.</li>
        <li><strong>Entry-level roles</strong> had about 2.1× more applications per posting than senior roles, pointing to concentrated demand and potential value in better matching and employer acquisition in that segment.</li>
        <li><strong>Finance and Customer Service</strong> showed a clear supply–demand gap: high application volume but moderate posting growth, so prioritising employer acquisition in these sectors could pay off.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritise employer acquisition and success in <strong>Healthcare, Education, and Finance</strong> to balance supply with demand.</li>
        <li>Build segment-specific landing and search experiences for high-intent categories (e.g. entry-level, tech) to improve match quality and conversion.</li>
        <li>Invest in <strong>Uganda and Tanzania</strong> with localised content and outreach, given their growth in postings and relative under-penetration.</li>
      </ul>
