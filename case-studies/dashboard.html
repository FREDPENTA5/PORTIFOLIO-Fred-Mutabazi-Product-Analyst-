    <h1 class="case-title">Product Health Dashboard</h1>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Leadership and product needed a single place to see marketplace health: active listings, application volume, employer and job seeker engagement, and leading indicators of growth or risk. Metrics were scattered across tools and required manual pulls; there was no shared definition of “platform health” or real-time view for decision-making.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>I worked with product and leadership to define a core set of KPIs (e.g. active job postings, new applications per day, application rate, time-to-fill, employer retention, job seeker DAU/WAU). I designed the schema and SQL for each metric, ensured consistent definitions and filters (e.g. excluding test data), and built the dashboard in Tableau with a simple layout: headline numbers at the top, then trend charts and breakdowns by segment (category, geography, experience level). The dashboard refreshed on a schedule and was shared via embedded link and weekly digest.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Key findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>12 core metrics</strong> were agreed and implemented; the dashboard became the default source for “how is the marketplace doing?” in leadership and product reviews.</li>
        <li>Real-time (or near real-time) refresh reduced time spent on manual reporting and aligned stakeholders on the same numbers.</li>
        <li>Segment breakdowns (e.g. by job category) surfaced which parts of the marketplace were growing or underperforming, informing roadmap and sales focus.</li>
        <li>Clear KPI definitions and documentation reduced confusion and ad hoc requests; new joiners could onboard to the metrics quickly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Add <strong>alerts</strong> (e.g. when a core metric moves beyond a threshold) so issues are caught without someone opening the dashboard daily.</li>
        <li>Extend the dashboard with <strong>cohort or retention views</strong> (e.g. employer retention by signup month) to support deeper product and growth analysis.</li>
        <li>Revisit KPI definitions quarterly with product and leadership to keep the dashboard aligned with strategy.</li>
      </ul>
