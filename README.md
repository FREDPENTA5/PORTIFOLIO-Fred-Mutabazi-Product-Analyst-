# Fred Mutabazi — Product Analyst Portfolio

A single-page portfolio that demonstrates how I use data, product thinking, and engineering experience to turn messy problems into clear, measurable outcomes.

This site focuses on real case studies, dashboards, and analyses that show how I approach product decisions using data.

## What this portfolio shows

This is not a design showcase.  
This is evidence of how I think and work as a Product Analyst.

You will find:

- Real case studies with business context
- Dashboards and analysis screenshots
- Clear **problem → analysis → insight → impact** storytelling
- How raw data becomes product decisions

---

## Design choices

The design is intentionally minimal and high-contrast so attention stays on the **analysis and insights**.

- Warm accent for emphasis
- Dark hero for strong first impression
- Professional typography for readability
- Structured layout: explanation on the left, evidence on the right

---

## Projects / Case Studies

Each case study includes:

- The product or business problem
- The data available
- The tools used (SQL, Excel, dashboards, etc.)
- The analysis performed
- The insight discovered
- The product or business impact

All images are screenshots of my own dashboards and analysis outputs.

2. Update the `src` in `index.html`, for example:
