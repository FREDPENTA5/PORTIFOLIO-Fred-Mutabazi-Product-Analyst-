# Fred Mutabazi — Product Analyst Portfolio

A single-page portfolio that demonstrates how I use data, product thinking, and engineering experience to turn messy problems into clear, measurable outcomes.

This site focuses on real case studies, dashboards, and analyses that show how I approach product decisions using data.

## What this portfolio shows

This is not a design showcase.  
This is evidence of how I think and work as a Product Analyst.

You will see:

- Real case studies with business context
- Dashboards and analysis screenshots
- Clear problem → analysis → insight → impact storytelling
- How raw data becomes product decisions

## Design choices (intentional)

The design is minimal and high-contrast on purpose — so attention stays on the **analysis and insights**, not decoration.

- Warm accent for emphasis and CTAs
- Dark hero for a strong first impression
- Professional typography for readability
- Structured project layout: explanation on the left, evidence (dashboards, charts, tables) on the right

## Projects / Case Studies

Each case study contains:

- The business or product problem
- The data available
- The tools used (SQL, Excel, dashboards, etc.)
- The analysis performed
- The insight discovered
- The product or business impact

The images used are screenshots of my own dashboards and analysis outputs.

## Replacing project images

Each project card contains an `<img>` inside:

`<figure class="project-figure">`

To use your own screenshots:

1. Add images to a folder, e.g. `images/`
2. Update the `src` in `index.html` to point to your files:
   - `images/retention-analysis.png`
   - `images/purchasing-habits-dashboard.png`
   - `images/funnel-analysis.png`

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.
